# Alias game

https://kubk.github.io/alias

A beautifully animated Alias game. It's a famous game to develop language skills. There are 2 teams, your aim is to make your teammates guess the word you are explaining by giving them hints and tips. For each correct guess the team gets a point. 

The app is optimized for mobile apps (try adding it to the home screen), but it also works on desktop. The game uses 2000 the most popular English words.

### Internals

It's a regular React PWA with Mobx used as a state manager. All the animations (swipe gestures, drag'n'drop, countdowns, modals appearance) are powered by framer-motion library.
